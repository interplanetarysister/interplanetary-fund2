# Full Feature Migration Ledger — Review Corrections

Effective: 2026-09-14

This addendum is normative for `docs/FULL_FEATURE_MIGRATION_LEDGER.md` until the ledger itself is revised. It records the valid Agent 2 findings and prevents downstream agents from relying on ambiguous or stale claims.

## 1. Runtime ownership boundary

`interplanetarysister/InterplanetaryFund` remains the named authoritative Convex/application backend candidate for existing payment, deduplication, agent-memory, and related bridge behavior. The Base44-first product workflow does **not** authorize replacing or stranding those backend-owned capabilities. Defer only infrastructure-specific migration or repair when direct deployment/runtime evidence is absent.

The Convex incident remains a separate P0 reliability workstream. No implementation may overwrite deployed Convex behavior until Production and Development identity, deployed commit, schema/index state, scheduler ownership, and function mapping are directly reconciled.

## 2. Runtime/version claims

Do not treat Node 22 or Node 24 as canonical from historical branches or copied documentation. The target runtime must be derived from the exact current `main` `package.json`, lockfile, version files, and active CI workflow. Any runtime change requires coordinated updates and exact-head verification. Until that evidence is captured, version status is `UNRESOLVED` rather than inferred.

## 3. Capability classifications corrected

The following capabilities must not be classified `PRESENT_NEEDS_VERIFICATION` solely from historical filenames when no current fund2 page/route evidence exists:

- Donors directory: `MISSING_SAFE_TO_IMPLEMENT` or `BLOCKED` pending privacy/product scope.
- Campaign comparison: `MISSING_SAFE_TO_IMPLEMENT` or `BLOCKED` pending privacy/product scope.

Historical source paths remain provenance evidence only; they do not prove current implementation.

## 4. Normative baseline dependencies

The ledger must be read together with:

- `docs/IF_FEATURE_RECONCILIATION_2026-08-21.md`;
- the Word-document requirements for IF #0.5–#23;
- current exact-main source and route evidence.

Those sources remain normative dependencies for Identity Graph, Communication Hub, Campaign OS, Community/Institution OS, Mission Control, analytics, subscriptions, Help, safety intelligence, and other previously inventoried capability families. A ledger row that omits one of those families is incomplete, not evidence of absence.

## 5. Mutable integration/provider state

Base44/GitHub/Google/OAuth/provider connection, ownership, credential, deployment, payment, and live-status claims are `UNRESOLVED` unless supported by authoritative environment/configuration evidence tied to the relevant account scope and environment. No connection may be inferred from repository names, stale screenshots, historical PR text, or a client-visible status alone.

## 6. Completion gate correction

A capability is not complete merely because it has a classification. Completion requires current source evidence, role/authorization and privacy analysis, payment/data-integrity implications where relevant, exact verification evidence, and explicit remaining gaps. Planned, historical, or partially implemented work must remain `IN_PROGRESS`, `BLOCKED`, `DEFERRED_INFRASTRUCTURE`, or `UNRESOLVED` as appropriate.

## 7. Traceability

This addendum is the Agent 1 correction slice for the latest Agent 2 findings on PR #205. It does not claim Node runtime validation, hosted/RLS validation, production deployment, Convex Development repair, merge, or publication.
