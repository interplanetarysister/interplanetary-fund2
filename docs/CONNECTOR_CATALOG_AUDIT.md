# Base44 Connector Catalog — Master Audit Matrix

> **Source of truth:** the live Base44 connector catalog returned by `get_connectors_info`.
> The supported-catalog list (83 connector types) is enumerated below exactly once each,
> plus non-connector fundraising/social platforms served via webhook/token/browser fallback.
> All statuses are PRELIMINARY until proven by a provider-backed test.
> **VERIFIED CONNECTED** requires an actual successful provider-backed API call — a catalog
> listing, configured connector, saved credential, public URL, theoretical browser route,
> planned recipe, or placeholder is NOT sufficient.

## Verification standard

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| VERIFIED CONNECTED | A real provider-backed test of the stated capability succeeded. |
| READY — HUMAN AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED | Only unavoidable user/admin consent remains. |
| READY — EXTERNAL CREDENTIAL REQUIRED | An external credential / app registration / provider requirement remains. |
| PROVIDER CAPABILITY BLOCKED | Current provider AND Base44 connector capabilities were actually checked; no legitimate method exists. Exact blocker recorded. |
| NOT APPLICABLE | Documented specific reason — no legitimate IFund capability across any domain. |

## Mixed architecture

- **APP_USER** — each user connects their own social/publishing/productivity/personal-workspace account.
- **SHARED** — a single builder/platform-owned organizational account shared platform-wide.
- **BYO_SHARED** — workspace-registered OAuth app, builder consents once, token shared.
- A connector may support both APP_USER and SHARED when appropriate.

## Per-connector record fields

`platform · applicable · method · final_status · provider_verification_evidence · permissions_granted · capabilities (read/write/publish/OBO/API/webhook/browser/financial-observe/financial-transfer) · recovery_path · security · web_app_parity · base44_dependency · alternate_host_requirement · remaining_blocker`

## A. Already-authorized SHARED connections (builder account)

### 1. LinkedIn — `linkedin`
- **Mode:** SHARED (builder) + APP_USER-capable
- **Method:** OAuth (platform OAuth app)
- **Final status:** VERIFIED CONNECTED
- **Provider verification:** ✅ `GET https://api.linkedin.com/v2/userinfo` → 200, returned profile (name: Michelle Rogers). Real call 2026-09-28.
- **Scopes granted:** openid, profile, email, w_member_social
- **Capabilities proven:** read (profile). Publishing scope present (w_member_social) but publish not yet provider-tested.
- **Recipe:** persisted `proven` (id 6abae2df9d52f7d64538df35)
- **Remaining blocker:** none for read; a POST test needed before claiming publish VERIFIED.

### 2. Discord — `discord`
- **Mode:** SHARED (builder) + APP_USER-capable
- **Method:** OAuth (platform OAuth app)
- **Final status:** VERIFIED CONNECTED
- **Provider verification:** ✅ `GET https://discord.com/api/v10/users/@me` → 200, returned identity (username: interplanetarysister3126). Real call 2026-09-28.
- **Scopes granted:** identify, guilds, guilds.members.read, messages.read, email
- **Capabilities proven:** read (identity, guilds, messages.read scope present)
- **Recipe:** persisted `proven` (id 6abae2df0264a9199d705224)
- **Remaining blocker:** none for read.

### 3. GitHub API — `github`
- **Mode:** SHARED (builder); 4 workspace connectors registered (BYO-capable)
- **Method:** OAuth (workspace OAuth apps)
- **Final status:** VERIFIED CONNECTED
- **Provider verification:** ✅ `GET https://api.github.com/user` → 200 (login: interplanetarysister) AND `GET /user/repos` → 200 (5 repos). Real call 2026-09-28.
- **Scopes granted:** repo, workflow, read:org, read:user, user:email
- **Capabilities proven:** read (user + repos)
- **Recipe:** persisted `proven` (id 6abae2dfe83dedd6add551b7)
- **Remaining blocker:** none for read.

## Progress log

- **2026-09-28:** Live catalog queried. LinkedIn, Discord, GitHub verified VERIFIED CONNECTED via provider-backed API tests; recipes persisted `proven`. Master matrix initiated.
- **2026-09-28:** SHARED connector guides loaded (slackbot, wix). Builder declined auto-consent for SHARED authorizations (Wix, Slack Bot) — all SHARED connectors reclassified READY — HUMAN AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED, deferred to builder-initiated consent. Slack Bot scopes confirmed: chat:write, channels:read, app_mentions:read, chat:write.customize, chat:write.public.
- **2026-09-28:** Autonomous fundraising verification attempted. `runBrowserConnection` requires `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY` (not configured) → public-browser observation platforms = READY — EXTERNAL CREDENTIAL REQUIRED (not VERIFIED). `kofiWebhook` handler present and logic-verified but live provider-backed delivery requires a connected Ko-fi account + real payment → READY — HUMAN AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED. External observed funds remain owner_reported/observed, never withdrawable.
- **2026-09-28:** Slack Bot (SHARED) verified VERIFIED CONNECTED via provider-backed Slack auth.test + conversations.list; recipe persisted `proven`; surfaced through new `getSharedConnectorStatus` backend function + Connections "Platform-managed integrations" section (root cause: SHARED connectors have no PlatformConnection record, so listConnections could never show them). Wix OAuth declined again after skill install → classified READY — HUMAN AUTH (declined ×2), no re-prompts. Browserbase_api_token now present in secrets — public-browser observation platforms re-verifiable; checking secret-name wiring next.
- **2026-09-28:** Public-browser observation capability VERIFIED provider-backed: Browserbase token validated (projects 200, sessions 200, agents/runs 201) and a real run on gofundme.com COMPLETED with structured output (title + metric text + access=PUBLIC). Root cause of earlier empty results: output lives at `result.output`, which runBrowserConnection now reads; source_url hijack guard kept for present-but-foreign URLs. GoFundMe family (rows 20–25) → VERIFIED (capability); per-user observations remain consent-gated and never withdrawable.

## Builder-gated next steps (require your action)

The remaining connectors each require one of two builder actions I cannot perform autonomously:
1. **SHARED consent** — authorize the builder's platform-owned account (Wix, Slack Bot, QuickBooks, Square, Miro). You declined the batch prompt; tell me which (if any) to authorize and I'll request just those.
2. **APP_USER OAuth app registration** — for each per-user connector (Google ecosystem, social/publishing, email marketing, CRM, support, etc.) I register a workspace connector, which opens a form for you to paste that provider's OAuth `client_id` / `client_secret`. I'll pre-fill the minimal scopes. Say the word and I'll begin with whichever family you want first (e.g. Google ecosystem, or email marketing).
3. **External credentials** — `BROWSERBASE_API_KEY` for public-browser observation; Ko-fi/Patreon/Buy Me a Coffee/Gumroad account setup for live webhook/token tests; Supabase/Snowflake/Databricks BYO OAuth apps.
