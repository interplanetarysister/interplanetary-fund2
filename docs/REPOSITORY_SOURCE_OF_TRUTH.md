# Interplanetary Fund — Repository Source-of-Truth Guide

**Effective:** 2026-09-06

This document tells application agents what belongs in this repository and where internal-agent/backend knowledge lives.

## Repository ownership

- **This repository (`interplanetarysister/interplanetary-fund2`, aka ifund2)**: authoritative consolidation destination for the user-facing Interplanetary Fund Base44 / React+Vite application, frontend, application entities/configuration, application-layer functions/agents, onboarding, Mission Control, Agent Chat, campaign/user UX, integrations presented to users, and application-specific behavior.
- **`interplanetarysister/InterplanetaryFund`**: authoritative Convex backend and internal-agent runtime, including persistent agent identity, permissions, memory, outcomes, orchestration, scheduled intelligence, treasury/payments backend, and backend protocol.
- **`interplanetarysister/interplanetary-fund-backend`**: legacy/reference only unless explicitly reassigned by the owner; do not add new production backend architecture there by default.
- Other historical, Vercel-only, duplicate, preview, or migration repositories are not alternate application targets. Treat them as evidence/migration sources unless explicitly reassigned.

This September 6, 2026 owner-authorized boundary supersedes historical documents that describe a different application consolidation direction.

## Consolidation policy

All pending or newly discovered **application-owned** updates that have not reached ifund2 must be reconciled into this repository rather than continuing parallel implementation elsewhere.

For every candidate update:
1. Verify the source behavior/data; never infer from labels, filenames, stale docs, or repository names.
2. Verify the current ifund2 implementation first.
3. Classify the difference as already consolidated, application migration candidate, backend-owned dependency, historical-only, or UNKNOWN.
4. Merge only verified application-owned behavior into the existing ifund2 implementation, preserving stable IDs/interfaces and valid current behavior.
5. Keep backend/runtime logic in `InterplanetaryFund` and expose it to ifund2 through explicit interfaces/bridges.
6. Verify authentication, authorization, payment/provider configuration, data ownership, and end-to-end runtime behavior before declaring consolidation complete.
7. Do not delete/archive a source implementation until equivalence and dependency removal are verified.

A Git commit is not runtime proof. Provider/feature status shown in the UI must come from verified capability/configuration/runtime evidence. This specifically applies to payment methods such as PayPal and Stripe: a stale frontend status must never override a verified working payment path.

## Issue #1 reconciliation

The original Issue #1 request to “bring all backend features repository improvements to this repo” predates this ownership model. Its safe current interpretation is:

- expose relevant backend capabilities in this application through explicit functions/APIs/bridges;
- implement application-facing behavior here;
- keep authoritative backend/runtime implementation in `InterplanetaryFund`;
- compare legacy backend capabilities before migrating them;
- never copy a backend merely to satisfy the historical wording or create a second source of truth.

See `docs/ISSUE_1_BACKEND_FEATURE_RECONCILIATION.md` for the durable completion record.

## Do not duplicate the internal agent knowledge base

The internal agent knowledge base is maintained in `InterplanetaryFund/interplanetary-fund-agent/`.

Application agents should reference the canonical material there when they need internal-agent context rather than copying it into this repository. The durable project decision archive is:
`InterplanetaryFund/docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT_ARCHIVE.md`

The internal-agent reference index is:
`InterplanetaryFund/docs/REFERENCE_MATERIAL_INDEX.md`

## Agent runtime boundary

Convex is authoritative for persistent agent identity, working/long-term memory, outcomes, permissions, and backend behavior. This application may display/mirror selected state and bridge user interactions to Convex, but it must not establish a competing production agent-memory or backend source of truth.

See `docs/AGENT_RUNTIME_UNIFICATION.md` for the current Base44↔Convex bridge and identity mapping.

## Role-specific workflow rule

The Convex Builder Agent workflow is not a universal application-agent workflow. Agents working on Convex/backend/agent-runtime implementation, review, verification, or publication must use the canonical backend workflow in `InterplanetaryFund/interplanetary-fund-agent/handoffs/CONVEX_BUILDER_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md` when applicable.

Other agents follow their role-specific instructions. All builders/reviewers/verifiers must follow the no-assumptions evidence rule for every action.

## Cross-repository changes

Never merge a change into a repository that does not own it. Cross-repository behavior must be implemented through an explicit interface, API, function, or bridge and verified at that boundary.

## Historical material

Historical feature reconciliations, recovered archives, audits, migration manifests, and legacy material are evidence/specification until verified against the current implementation. Do not recreate functionality solely because an old document mentions it, and do not execute historical shutdown/decommission instructions as if they were current approval.

## Continuity

When a decision materially changes application/backend boundaries, agent roles, workflow, or source-of-truth rules:
1. Update this document.
2. Update the canonical backend/agent document when applicable.
3. Update affected role-specific instructions/reference material.
4. Record the decision in the durable project archive.
