// The Universal Connections catalog — every fundraising and social destination
// Interplanetary Fund can link to.
//
// Each entry carries:
//   id           — stable platform key used in PlatformConnection records
//   name         — display name
//   kind         — "crowdfunding" | "social"
//   color        — brand accent for the plugin card background/icon
//   icon         — emoji or short symbol shown on the card
//   tagline      — one line: what connecting gives you
//   setupKind    — "link"    → paste a URL + optional totals (no credentials)
//                  "token"   → paste one secret (webhook token, app password…)
//                  "oauth"   → provider OAuth flow (button, no manual paste)
//                  "multi"   → two or more credential fields
//   steps        — ordered array of step descriptors used by the connect wizard
//   api          — legacy one-liner kept for backward compatibility
