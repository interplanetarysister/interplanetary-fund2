// full letter expands behind "Read more · Our Story".
const OPENING = [
  "Thank you for giving me the opportunity to introduce you to Interplanetary Fund.",
  "I want to start with a simple question: What if raising money for a cause, a business idea, a personal need, or a dream didn't require people to navigate a dozen different platforms?",
  "What if the technology could bring the fundraising ecosystem together?",
  "That is the idea behind Interplanetary Fund.",
];

const STORY = [
  { h: "The problem we're solving", p: "Today, people who need funding are often forced to piece together their fundraising strategy across crowdfunding platforms, social media, messaging, email, and other tools. They create a campaign in one place, promote it somewhere else, communicate with supporters somewhere else, analyze results somewhere else, and try to figure out what to do next on their own." },
  { h: "An operating system for fundraising", p: "We believe fundraising should be much more connected than that. Interplanetary Fund is being built as an intelligent fundraising platform designed to bring those activities together into one ecosystem. At its core, our platform gives campaign creators a central place to create, manage, promote, understand, and grow their campaigns. But we're not trying to build just another crowdfunding website. We're building an operating system for fundraising." },
  { h: "Connect campaigns with what they need", p: "Our vision is to connect campaigns with the people, platforms, communication channels, and intelligence they need to succeed. Imagine creating one campaign and having the platform help you determine where that campaign should be promoted. Imagine connecting your social accounts and eventually being able to distribute approved campaign content across multiple networks instead of manually recreating the same post over and over. Imagine having one dashboard that shows campaign performance, communication, opportunities, and the next actions that could make the biggest difference." },
  { h: "An assistant — not the person in charge", p: "And imagine an AI assistant that doesn't simply generate text, but actually helps you understand your campaign and recommends what you should consider doing next. That's where our Campaign Coach and Mission Control concepts come in. The AI is designed to act as an assistant — not as the person in charge. It can analyze information, identify opportunities, help improve campaign messaging, and recommend actions. But the human remains in control. That distinction is extremely important to us." },
  { h: "Because fundraising is about trust", p: "Because fundraising isn't just about technology. It's about trust. When someone contributes their money, they're putting trust in the person asking for help. That's why we're designing Interplanetary Fund around transparency, trust signals, campaign information, communication, and accountability." },
  { h: "Beyond individual campaigns", p: "We're also thinking beyond individual campaigns. Our long-term vision is an ecosystem where individuals, organizations, communities, institutions, and eventually businesses can participate in a connected funding network. And the opportunity is much larger than simply collecting donations. The real opportunity is the infrastructure surrounding fundraising: Discovery. Communication. Distribution. Analytics. Automation. Donor relationships. Campaign intelligence. And eventually, a network connecting people who need funding with people looking for meaningful opportunities to contribute. That creates multiple potential paths for growth and monetization." },
  { h: "Something people genuinely want to use", p: "But our first priority is not maximizing the number of revenue streams. It's building something people genuinely want to use. We want someone with a great idea and no marketing department to have access to capabilities that previously required a team. We want a nonprofit to be able to operate more efficiently. We want a family raising money for an important need to spend less time fighting technology and more time reaching people. And we want organizations to eventually have a sophisticated fundraising operating system available to them without having to assemble dozens of disconnected products." },
  { h: "Turning What if into What happens next", p: "That's the larger vision. Interplanetary Fund is not just about helping people raise money. It's about making the process of turning an idea into momentum easier. Because every successful campaign begins with a question: What if? What if this idea worked? What if this project became real? What if enough people believed in it? What if the right person discovered it at exactly the right moment? Interplanetary Fund exists to help create that possibility. We are building the infrastructure that can help turn \u201cWhat if?\u201d into \u201cWhat happens next?\u201d" },
  { h: "Our ambition is global", p: "And that's why we're here today. We're looking for partners who see the potential to build a much larger ecosystem around how people fund ideas, causes, projects, and possibilities. Our ambition is global. Our technology is being built with scalability in mind. And our long-term goal is simple: Create a world where great ideas have a better chance of finding the people, resources, and momentum they need to become reality." },
